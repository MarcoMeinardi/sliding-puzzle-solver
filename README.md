# Sliding puzzle solver
A simple sliding puzzle you can play with in command prompt using arrows <br>
Other instructions are available in 'Sliding_puzzle.cpp' file <br>
The solver is not optimal it just an implementation of the classic resolution method you can find [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-Slide-Puzzles)<br>
The first number of the solution indicate the number you should place in the black spot <br>
<br>
I wrote this program in order to solve [this problem](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a20eeccee1aae3cbc000090) <br>
Because of how i wrote the program you can just play with square puzzle, maybe one day i'll work to fix this problem <br>
<br>
Have fun!!
